# Stability Based Comparison of PDE Solvers - Von Neumann Analysis

This project was done as a requirement of the course EP2130 - Mathematical Physics. It aims to find the stability of
various Finite Difference Methods for Linear, Constant Coefficient PDEs  (Mainly the Linear Advection Equation and the 
Heat Equation) by von Neumann Stability Analysis (vNSA).

The stability regions for all the FDMs tested were determined by plotting a heat map using the results of vNSA
The initial parameters (Spatial Discretization, Advection Speed, etc.) can be modified in the section before the
analytical solution. Feel free to experiment with different parameters. (Make sure you run the changed cells before 
experimenting, I forgot that way too many times and lost like half of my brain cells crashing out on why something that
worked suddenly stopped working but *ahem*... enough aboot that {No that's not a typo}).

The project report is attached in the repo. Make sure you go through it before going through the Jupyter Notebook.

Enjoy :)
